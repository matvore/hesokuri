(defmacro letmap
  "A macro that behaves like let, creating temporary bindings for variables, and
  also creates a map containing the bindings. An abbreviated form is supplied
  which simply evaluates to the map, which is useful for creating maps where
  some entries are used to calculate other entries. For instance, the
  abbreviated form:
    (letmap [a 10, b (* a 20)])
  evaluates to:
    {:a 10, :b 200}

  In the full form, the symbol immediately after the macro name is the name of
  the map that can be used in the let body:
    (letmap m [a 10, b (* a 20)]
      (into m [[:c m]]))
  evaluates to:
    {:a 10, :b 200, :c {:a 10, :b 200}}

  Bindings can be preceded by omit to create a let binding but to not put the
  value in the map. This is useful for values that store intermediate results.
    (letmap [:omit a 10, b (* a a)])
  evaluates to:
    {:b 100}

  In place of a binding you can use the :keep modifier, which indicates that the
  variable is already bound in this scope and you just want to add it to the map
  with a key of the same name:
  (defn new-foo [x y]
   (letmap [:keep [x y], z (+ x y)]))
  Then (new-foo 5 10) evaluates to: {:x 5, :y 10, :z 15}
  Instead of a vector after :keep you can specify a single symbol, it which case
  it would be treated as if it were a vector containing only that symbol."
